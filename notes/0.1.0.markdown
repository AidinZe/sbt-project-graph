  [DOT]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOT_(graph_description_language)

- Initial implementation.
- Features `projectsGraphDot` which outputs a [DOT][] file inside the target directory.
- The project's dependency graph uses `ProjectDefinition.uses`, which includes both the projects aggregated over
  and the projects that are classpath dependencies.
- Removes redundant direct dependencies that are also present transitively via another direct dependency. This
  is done to output a cleaner graph.
